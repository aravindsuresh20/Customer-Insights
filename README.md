### Loan Approval Prediction using Flask and RandomForestClassifier

This is a web application for predicting loan approval status based on various banking parameters using a machine learning model. The application is built with Flask and utilizes a RandomForestClassifier for predictions.

### Features

* **Loan Prediction**: Predicts loan status (Approved, Closed, Rejected) based on user input.
* **Backend EDA**: Performs exploratory data analysis on the dataset and saves a summary.
* **Interactive Web Interface**: Simple forms for input and displaying prediction results.
* **Result Download**: Allows users to download the prediction result as a text file.

### Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

* **Python 3.6+**
* **Flask**: Web framework.
* **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
* **scikit-learn**: For machine learning model (RandomForestClassifier).
* **pickle**: For saving and loading the trained model.

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Note: A requirements.txt file would need to be created containing the above libraries.)
Installation
1.	Clone the repository (or set up project directory):
Bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/loan-approval-prediction.git](https://github.com/yourusername/loan-approval-prediction.git)
cd loan-approval-prediction
2.	Place your dataset: Ensure your dataset, named Comprehensive_Banking_Database.csv, is in the same directory as app.py and model.py.
3.	Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
Bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
4.	Install dependencies:
Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
5.	Run the model training script (to generate loan_approval_model.pkl):
Bash
python model.py
This script trains the RandomForestClassifier and saves the trained model as loan_approval_model.pkl. It also prints the accuracy and classification report of the model.
6.	Run the Flask app:
Bash
python app.py
7.	Open the application in your browser:

Usage
1.	Backend EDA: When app.py starts, it will automatically perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the
Comprehensive_Banking_Database.csv and save a summary in eda_summary.txt.
This file will contain summary statistics, missing values, and the correlation matrix of the numerical features.
2.	Access the Home Page: Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000. You will see a form to input various
 banking details.
3.	Enter Loan Details: Fill in the required fields such as Age, Gender, Account Balance,
 Transaction Amount, Loan Amount, Interest Rate, and Loan Term.
4.	Get Prediction: Click the "Predict Loan Status" button. The application will use the trained model
to predict the loan approval status.
5.	View Results: The prediction (Approved, Closed, or Rejected) will be displayed on the results page.
6.	Download Result: On the results page, you will find a link to download the prediction result as a text file.
